Tutorial
--------

As a frst example, we will size a direct-drive Permanent Magnet synchronous Generator (PMSG) for the NREL 5MW Reference Model :cite:`FAST2009`.  

The first step is to import the relevant files.

.. literalinclude:: examples/example.py
    :start-after: # 1 ---
    :end-before: # 1 ---

We will start with the radial flux PMSG with spoke arm arrangement.  The PMSG module relies on inputs from the rotor such as rated speed, 
power rating and rated torque.  It also requires specification of shear stress, material properties( densities), specific costs and target design efficiency.
and initialization of electromagnetic and structural design variables necessary to calculate basic design. Specification of the optimisation 
objective(Costs,Mass, Efficiency or Aspect ratio) and driver determines the final design. The designs are generated in compliance with the user-specified constraints on generator 
terminal voltage and constraints imposed on the dimensions and electrical,magnetic and structural deformations. The excitation requirement (e.g., magnet dimensions,pole pairs) 
is determined in accordance with the required voltage at no-load. 

.. literalinclude:: examples/example.py
    :start-after: # 2 ---
    :end-before: # 2 ---


We now run the PMSG_arms module.

.. literalinclude:: examples/example.py
    :start-after: # 3 ---
    :end-before: # 3 ---


The resulting system and component properties can then be printed.

These result file can be read into the the MATALB script [Par_GeneratorSE_FEMM_PMSG.m] to populate the 2D finite element mesh model in FEMM and perform a magnetostatic analysis.

As a second example, we will design a gear driven Doubly fed Induction generator(DFIG).  The DFIG design 
relies on inputs such as machine rating, target overall drivetrain efficiency, gearbox efficiency,
high speed shaft speed( or gear ratio).It also requires specification of shear stress, material properties( densities), specific material costs. 
The main design variables are initialized with an objective and driver. The designs are computed analytically and checked against predefined constraints 
to meet objective functions.In addition, calculations of mass properties are also made.
We now instantiate the DFIG object which automatically updates the mass, costs, efficiency and performance variables based on the supplied inputs.
