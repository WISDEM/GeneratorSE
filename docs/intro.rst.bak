Introduction
------------

Generator Systems Engineering (GeneratorSE) is a set of analytical frameworks for sizing variable speed wind turbine Generators. The tool integrates electromagnetic, structural, and basic thermal design to provide the optimal generator design dimensions using conventional magnetic circuit laws.
GeneratorSE can be used as an autonomous tool focused on generator design or integrated in the system using DriveSE, NREL’s drivetrain sizing tool . Thus, the designer has the option to trade magnet, copper, or lamination properties and weights to achieve the optimal generator design that is also optimal for a given drivetrain system. Two types of generator systems— synchronous and induction machines—are currently being handled by GeneratorSE.  The tool includes the following subclasses: permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) electrically excited synchronous generators (EESGs), squirrel-cage induction generators (SCIGs), and doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs). the designer has the option to trade magnet, copper, or lamination properties and weights to achieve the optimal generator design that is also optimal for a given drivetrain system.

The tool includes optimisation modules for four sub-classes: 

1. Permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) 
2. Electrically excited synchronous generator (EESG), 
3. Squirrel-cage induction generators (SCIG), and 
4. Doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG)
